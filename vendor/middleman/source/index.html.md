title: DataCite REST API
description: The API to interact with all DataCite resources.
---

The DataCite REST API allows users to interact with DataCite resources such as dois, clients, providers and prefixes. Please use 
[DataCite Search](https://search.datacite.org) or [DOI Fabrica](https://doi.datacite.org) (for members and clients) if you are looking for a web interface. The API follows the [JSONAPI](http://jsonapi.org/) specification. The API requires authentication for some actions.

You will find more information about the REST API in our [documentation portal](https://support.datacite.org/docs/api).
